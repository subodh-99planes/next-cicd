You watch as the waves roll onto the shore, leaving white froth as they recede back into the depths of the turquoise ocean. You hear the calming rhythm of the waves as they break on the shore. As you breathe in, the fresh ocean air fills your lungs completely. You can taste the salt of the ocean.  It is nearing sunset. The sun is sinking closer to the horizon. Its colour changing from bright yellow to orange – inching even closer to the horizon. As you gaze over the horizon, you notice a single star in the sky.dfdg"
